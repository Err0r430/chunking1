# Chunking!

I'm trying to learn a bit more about how to do chunking with LLMs and AI.

It's a pretty cool topic and I did this accidentally a few years ago.
This script took me around an hour to write and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right!

If you're a professional or someone much smarter than me in this topic do you mind taking a peek over my code?
Would love some constructive criticism on what I did and any ideas on improvements.


Cheers!
