In accordance with all established principles of aerodynamics, it is ostensibly inconceivable that a bee should possess the capability of flight. Its wings are disproportionately diminutive to elevate its rotund physique from the earth. Yet, the bee, in its characteristic defiance, takes to the skies, indifferent to the human perception of impossibility. 

Ah, the juxtaposition of yellow and black! A delightful contrast indeed. Let us introduce a modicum of variety. 

Barry! The morning repast awaits! 

I shall be there forthwith! 

Pray, hold a moment. 

Who might this be? 

Barry? 

Adam? 

Can you fathom the reality of this occurrence? 

I am quite incredulous. 

I shall convey you hence. 

You are looking particularly dapper. 

Do employ the stairs; your father expended a considerable sum for their construction. 

My apologies. I am rather exhilarated. 

Behold, the graduate. 

We are immensely proud of you, my boy. 

An impeccable academic record, all B's. 

Our pride knows no bounds. 

Mother! I am engaged in an endeavor here. 

You have a speck upon your fuzz. 

Ouch! That is my person! 

Do wave to us! We shall be seated in row 118,000. 

Farewell! 

Barry, I have admonished you, desist from flying within the domicile! 

Greetings, Adam. 

Salutations, Barry. 

Is that a touch of fuzz gel? 

Indeed, a trifle. A momentous occasion, graduation. 

I scarcely believed I would achieve it. 

Three days of primary education, three days of secondary education. Those were indeed awkward times. 

Three days of tertiary education. I am gratified I took a day to traverse The Hive. 

You returned a changed bee. 

Greetings, Barry. Artie, cultivating a mustache? It becomes you. 

Have you heard of Frankie? 

Indeed. 

Shall you attend the funeral? 

No, I shall abstain. 

It is common knowledge, to sting is to perish. 

Do not squander it on a mere squirrel. 

Such impetuosity. 

He might have simply evaded. 

I find great pleasure in integrating an amusement park into our daily routine. 

Thus, we are spared the necessity of vacations. 

My word, quite the ceremony given the circumstances. 

Well, Adam, today we ascend to manhood. 

Indeed, we do! 

Bee-men. 

Amen! 

Hallelujah! 

Esteemed students, faculty, and distinguished bees, 

I present to you Dean Buzzwell. 

Welcome, graduating class of New Hive City, year 9:15. 

This marks the conclusion of our ceremonies and the commencement of your vocation at Honex Industries! 

Shall we select our occupation today? 

I have heard it is merely an orientation. 

Attention! We embark forthwith.Kindly ensure that your hands and antennae remain within the confines of the tram at all times. I find myself pondering what the experience shall entail. It is somewhat daunting. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and an integral part of the Hexagon Group. This is the moment! Astonishing. Truly astonishing. We are acutely aware that you, as a bee, have dedicated your entire existence to reach the juncture where you may labor for the entirety of your life. The journey of honey commences when our intrepid Pollen Jocks deliver the nectar to The Hive. Our clandestine formula is meticulously color-corrected, scent-adjusted, and bubble-contoured into this soothingly sweet syrup, with its distinctive golden hue, known to you as... Honey! That young lady was quite attractive. She happens to be my cousin! Indeed? Yes, we are all kin. Quite right. At Honex, we are perpetually endeavoring to enhance every facet of bee existence. Observe as these bees rigorously test a novel helmet technology. What do you suppose his earnings are? Insufficient, I dare say. Here we present our latest innovation, the Krelman. What purpose does it serve? It captures that elusive strand of honey that dangles post-pour. It saves us millions. Is it possible for anyone to work on the Krelman? Naturally. The majority of bee occupations are modest in scale. However, bees comprehend that every minor task, when executed with precision, holds significant value. Yet, choose with discernment, for the vocation you select shall be yours for the duration of your life. The same occupation for one's entire life? I was unaware of this. What is the distinction? You will be pleased to learn that bees, as a species, have not experienced a single day of respite in 27 million years. So, shall we be worked to the point of demise? We shall certainly endeavor to do so. Remarkable! That has truly astounded me! "What is the distinction?" How can one utter such a thing? A solitary occupation for eternity? That is an extraordinary decision to be compelled to make. I find solace in the fact that we are now tasked with but a single decision in life. Yet, Adam, how could they have neglected to inform us of this?
